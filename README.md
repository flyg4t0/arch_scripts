# arch_script
This is for creating and formating a disk to make it ready for an Arch installation.  It will create a EFI and a BTRFS partitions.  Then create the subvolumes (@, @home, @log, @pkg, @snapshots) and mount them.  Thats it.  You can then use the archinstall script to finish the instalation.
